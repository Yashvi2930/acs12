    <h1> PROJECT-BASED LEARNING
Project-based learning is involving students in real work, with a real need, for a real audience. Often it is multi-disciplinary (like the real world), it includes 21st Century skills (like collaboration and use of technology), it includes a significant entry event, it answers a driving question, it connects students to adults in industry, it stretches their inquiry, it has a social justice component, and it requires a presentation. One project included the secondary foods and biology classes combining to host a banquet of sustainable seafood for parents, community members, and professionals. All of this occurs in the context of what it means to SHAPE GODâ€™S WORLD in this 21st Century.
