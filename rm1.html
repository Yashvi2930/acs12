    <h1>Information Technology</h1>
    <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.</p>

    

    <h2>What does information technology encompass?</h2>
    <p>
        The IT department ensures that the organization's systems, networks, data and applications all connect and function properly. The IT team handles three major areas:

deploys and maintains business applications, services and infrastructure (servers, networks, storage);
monitors, optimizes and troubleshoots the performance of applications, services and infrastructure; and
oversees the security and governance of applications, services and infrastructure.
